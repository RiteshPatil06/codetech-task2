## **Cat vs Dog Image Classification Using TensorFlow**

### **Overview**
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. Using TensorFlow, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn features from input images and predict whether an image belongs to the "cat" or "dog" category.

### **Key Objectives**
1. Train a deep learning model to accurately classify images of cats and dogs.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
3. Provide visualizations of training progress and results.

### **Steps Involved**

#### **1. Data Collection**
The dataset typically includes labeled images of cats and dogs, such as the Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset. Each image belongs to one of the two classes:
- Class 0: Cat
- Class 1: Dog

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Resizing Images**: All images are resized to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) to maintain uniformity.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting are applied to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

#### **3. Dataset Preparation**
- Split the dataset into:
  - **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
  - **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
  - **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.
- TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` or `tf.data` API can be used for efficient data loading and preprocessing.

#### **4. Model Design**
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is designed to capture spatial features from images:
  - **Convolution Layers**: Extract spatial features using filters.
  - **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensions and computation.
  - **Dense Layers**: Perform classification based on the extracted features.
- **Activation Functions**:
  - ReLU for non-linearity in hidden layers.
  - Sigmoid (or Softmax) for binary classification output.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function outputs the probability of the image being a dog.

#### **5. Training**
- Compile the model with:
  - **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy for binary classification.
  - **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
  - **Metrics**: Accuracy for evaluating performance.
- Train the model using the training data and validate using the validation set.
- Use callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint` to optimize training.

#### **6. Evaluation**
- Evaluate the trained model on the test set using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy curves.

#### **7. Visualization**
- Display sample predictions with confidence scores.
- Visualize filters and feature maps to interpret how the model learns.

#### **8. Deployment**
- Save the trained model in a format compatible with deployment (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel format).
- Use the model in a web or mobile application to classify user-uploaded images.

### **Expected Results**
1. **Accuracy**: The model should achieve reasonable accuracy (~90%) depending on dataset quality and preprocessing.
2. **Learning Curves**: Training and validation curves will show model performance over epochs.
3. **Sample Predictions**: Showcase correct and incorrect classifications with confidence scores.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Use Transfer Learning with pretrained models like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet for better performance.
2. Deploy the model using TensorFlow Lite for mobile applications.
3. Fine-tune hyperparameters for further optimization.
